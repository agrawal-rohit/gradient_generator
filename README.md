This is just a simple web app for creating and browsing pretty UI gradients for design. The primary objective of the app was to learn DOM manipulation with javascript and to create a full stack web app consisting of a backend and database with CRU (Create, Read, Update) functionality. The app is based on a MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).
